/// High-level MCP client providing automatic reconnection, health monitoring,
/// and transparent retry on recoverable errors.
///
/// `MCPClient` wraps `Client` the same way `MCPServer` wraps `Server`:
/// - `MCPServer` manages sessions, shared registries, notification broadcasting
/// - `MCPClient` manages connection lifecycle, reconnection, health monitoring
///
/// These features work with any transport. For example, if a stdio server process
/// crashes, `MCPClient` re-invokes the transport factory to spawn a new process.
/// When used with `HTTPClientTransport`, `MCPClient` additionally hooks into
/// session expiration and event stream status callbacks for proactive reconnection.
///
/// ## Key Behaviors
///
/// - **Automatic reconnection**: When the connection drops or a session expires,
///   `MCPClient` creates a fresh transport and reconnects the underlying `Client`.
/// - **Deduplication**: Multiple concurrent failures trigger only one reconnection.
/// - **Transparent retry**: Protocol methods catch recoverable errors (session
///   expiration, connection closed, transport errors), reconnect, and retry the
///   operation once before propagating the error.
/// - **Health monitoring**: Optional periodic ping detects stale connections proactively.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let mcpClient = MCPClient(name: "MyApp", version: "1.0")
///
/// // Register handlers before connecting (same as Client)
/// await mcpClient.client.withSamplingHandler { params, context in
///     // handle sampling
/// }
///
/// // Connect with a transport factory (re-invoked on reconnection)
/// try await mcpClient.connect {
///     HTTPClientTransport(endpoint: URL(string: "https://example.com/mcp")!)
/// }
///
/// // Tool calls automatically retry on session expiration
/// let result = try await mcpClient.callTool(name: "my_tool", arguments: ["key": .string("value")])
/// ```
