// MARK: - Server Handler Registry

/// Registry of handlers for responding to client requests and notifications.
///
/// This struct consolidates all handler-related state in one place, making it
/// easier to manage and reason about. Unlike `ClientHandlerRegistry`, this struct
/// does not include capability inference since Server capabilities are managed
/// differently (either set explicitly or auto-detected by MCPServer).
struct ServerHandlerRegistry {
    /// Request handlers keyed by method name.
    var methodHandlers: [String: RequestHandlerBox] = [:]

    /// Notification handlers keyed by notification name.
    /// Multiple handlers can be registered for the same notification type.
    var notificationHandlers: [String: [NotificationHandlerBox]] = [:]

    /// Fallback handler for requests with no registered handler.
    ///
    /// If set, this handler is called for any incoming request that doesn't have
    /// a specific handler registered. Useful for debugging, logging unknown methods,
    /// or forward-compatibility with new MCP features.
    var fallbackRequestHandler: RequestHandlerBox?

    /// Fallback handler for notifications with no registered handler.
    ///
    /// If set, this handler is called for any incoming notification that doesn't have
    /// a specific handler registered. Useful for debugging or logging unknown notifications.
    var fallbackNotificationHandler: NotificationHandlerBox?

    /// In-flight request handler Tasks, tracked by request ID.
    /// Used for protocol-level cancellation when CancelledNotification is received.
    var inFlightHandlerTasks: [RequestId: Task<Void, Never>] = [:]
}

/// Model Context Protocol server.
///
/// ## Architecture: One Server per Client
///
/// The Swift SDK uses a **one-Server-per-client** architecture, where each client
/// connection gets its own `Server` instance. This mirrors the TypeScript SDK's
/// design and differs from Python's shared-Server model.
///
/// ### Comparison with Other SDKs
///
/// **Python SDK (shared Server):**
/// ```
/// ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
/// │           Server (ONE)               │
/// │  - Handler registry (shared)         │
/// │  - No connection state               │
/// └──────────────────────────────────────┘
///          │ server.run() creates ↓
/// ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
/// │ Session A   │  │ Session B   │
/// │ (Transport) │  │ (Transport) │
/// └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
/// ```
///
/// **Swift & TypeScript SDKs (per-client Server):**
/// ```
/// ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
/// │  Server A   │  │  Server B   │
/// │ (Handlers)  │  │ (Handlers)  │
/// │ (Transport) │  │ (Transport) │
/// └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
/// ```
///
/// ### Scalability Considerations
///
/// The per-client model is appropriate for MCP's typical use cases:
/// - AI assistants connecting to tool servers (single-digit connections)
/// - IDE plugins and developer tools (tens of connections)
/// - Multi-user applications (hundreds of connections)
///
/// Memory overhead per Server instance is minimal (a few KB for handler references
/// and state). For realistic MCP deployments, this scales well.
///
/// For high-connection scenarios (10,000+), consider:
/// - Horizontal scaling with connection-time load balancing
/// - MCP's stateless mode for true per-request distribution
/// - The Python SDK's shared-Server pattern (requires architectural changes)
///
/// ### Design Rationale
///
/// The per-client model was chosen because it:
/// 1. Matches TypeScript SDK's official examples and patterns
/// 2. Provides complete isolation between client connections
/// 3. Simplifies reasoning about connection state
/// 4. Avoids complex session management code
///
/// For HTTP transports, each session creates its own `(Server, HTTPServerTransport)`
/// pair, stored by session ID for request routing.
///
/// ## API Design: Context vs Server Methods
///
/// The `RequestHandlerContext` provides request-scoped capabilities:
/// - `requestId`, `_meta` - Request identification and metadata
/// - `sendNotification()` - Send notifications during handling
/// - `elicit()`, `elicitUrl()` - Request user input (matches Python's `ctx.elicit()`)
/// - `isCancelled` - Check for request cancellation
///
/// Sampling is done via `server.createMessage()` (matches TypeScript), not through
/// the context. This design follows each reference SDK's conventions where appropriate.
public actor Server: ProtocolLayer {
    /// The server configuration
    public struct Configuration: Hashable, Codable, Sendable {
        /// The default configuration (strict mode enabled).
        ///
        /// This matches Python SDK behavior where the server rejects non-ping requests
        /// before initialization at the session level. TypeScript SDK only enforces this
        /// at the HTTP transport level, not at the server/session level.
        ///
        /// We chose to align with Python because:
        /// - Consistent behavior across all transports (stdio, HTTP, in-memory)
        /// - More defensive - prevents misbehaving clients from accessing functionality before init
        /// - Better aligns with MCP spec intent (clients "SHOULD NOT" send requests before init)
