/// Helpers for building and validating server capabilities.

/// This enum namespace contains static functions for capability merging and validation.
/// Unlike `ClientCapabilityHelpers`, the Server's capability inference is simpler since
/// capabilities are typically set explicitly or auto-detected by MCPServer based on
/// registration flags.

    /// This performs two steps:
    /// 1. Creates capability objects (with `listChanged: true`) for registered
    ///    features that don't already have an explicit capability object.
    /// 2. Defaults any `nil` `listChanged` field to `true` within existing
    ///    capability objects, preserving explicit `false`.
    ///
    /// Explicit base capabilities take precedence where provided.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - base: Base capabilities (explicit overrides from initializer).
    ///   - hasTools: Whether tools have been registered.
    ///   - hasResources: Whether resources have been registered.
    ///   - hasPrompts: Whether prompts have been registered.
    /// - Returns: The merged capabilities.
